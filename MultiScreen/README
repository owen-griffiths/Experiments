C# Utility which uses native interop to register a keyboard hook which allows placement of Windows applications without relying on a mouse. This utility is based on the Linux Unity shortcuts listed below, with 2 extensions:

Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 7 - Place window in top left corner of screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 8 - Place window in top half of screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 9 - Place window in top right corner of screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 4 - Place window on the left half of the screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 5 - Maximize the window on the screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 6 - Place window on the right half of the screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 1 - Place window in the bottom left corner of the screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 2 - Place window in the bottom half of the screen.
Ctrl-Alt-Numpad 3 - Place window in the bottom right corner of the screen.

The first extension is support for multiple monitors, possibly with different resolutions. The shortcuts above will place the current focus window on the specified portion of the left most monitor. To move a window to the 2nd monitor add a "Nunpad +" to the keyboard sequence (without lifting Ctrl - Alt). If the system has 3 monitors, press "Numpad +" twice.

Some examples, assuming a 3 monitor system, the window will end up on the screen portion denoted with #
Ctrl Alt, "+ + 6"

The second extension is using 2 numbers to define a area of the screen. If the shortcut stream includes 2 numbers, the screen is divided into 9ths, more directly mapped to the layout of the numeric keypad. The window will be placed in the rectangle that includes the 2 selected blocks, eg

Ctrl Alt, "+ + 6 1"
